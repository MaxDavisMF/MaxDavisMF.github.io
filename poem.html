<h1> Shakespeare - Sonnet 27</h1>

  <p>Weary with <mark>toil</mark>, I haste me to my bed,<br>
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;<br>
But then begins a journey in my head,<br>
<mark>To work my mind</mark>, when body's work's expired:<br>
    For then my thoughts <mark>(from far where I abide)</mark><br>
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,<br>
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,<br>
Looking on darkness which the blind do see:<br>
Save that my soul's imaginary sight<br>
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,<br>
Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,<br>
    Makes <mark>black night</mark> beauteous and her old face new.<br>
Lo, thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,<br>
    For thee, and for myself, <mark>no quiet</mark> find.<br>
  </p>

Sonnet 27 is one of 154 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnet"> sonnets </a> published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare"> William Shakespeare</a> in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarto"> quarto </a> titled Shakespeare's Sonnets in 1609. It is a part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare%27s_sonnets#Fair_YouthFair"> Youth group </a> of sonnets, and the first in a group of five sonnets that portray the poet in solitude and meditating from a distance on the young man. A theme of the first two of the group (sonnets 27 - 28) regards the night and restlessness, which is a motif also found in the sonnets of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarch"> Petrarch</a>.

   In Sonnet 27 the weary poet cannot find rest — not day or night. He goes to bed weary after working hard, which is the <mark>"toil"</mark> of line one, and the <mark>"travail"</mark> of line three. As soon as he lies down, another journey begins in his thoughts (<mark>"To work my mind"</mark>) — the destination is the young man, who is far from where the poet is (<mark>"from far where I abide"</mark>). The poet's thoughts take that journey, and though he sees nothing but the darkness of night, his imagination presents to him an image of the young man, an image that seems to hang before him in the dark, like a jewel. This vision makes the <mark>"black night"</mark> beautiful — the word <mark>"black"</mark> is equated with ugliness and <mark>"night"</mark> has a feminine aspect. The reader is led to expect this vision to improve the poet's lot, but the final couplet suggests that it only adds to the restless misery of the weary poet, and <mark>"no quiet"</mark> can the poet find.
