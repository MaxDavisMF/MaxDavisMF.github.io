<h1> Shakespeare - Sonnet 27</h1>

    <img src="shakespeare.jpeg" alt="A picture of shakespeare">
    
 <p>Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,<br>
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;<br>
But then begins a journey in my head,<br>
To work my mind, when body's work's expired:<br>
For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)<br>
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,<br>
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,<br>
Looking on darkness which the blind do see:<br>
Save that my soul's imaginary sight<br>
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,<br>
Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,<br>
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.<br>
Lo, thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,<br>
For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.<br>
  </p>
  <P>
